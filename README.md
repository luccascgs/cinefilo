# Cinéfilo

## About

Cinéfilo was based in [Termo](https://term.ooo/) and [Contexto](https://contexto.me/), popular games from Brazil, that you need to find the correct answer, but in Cinéfilo you need to guess the movie name.
The project started with an discussion about how can we simplify the lesson idea and we diceded focus on an single game and we decided make an website based on one of the games that we've selected. We tried to think how can we make an mimic game, like "Jogo da Mímica", but online.
